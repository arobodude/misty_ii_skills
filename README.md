# Ian's Misty II Skills Repo!
Repository of the Misty II skills I've created. Enjoy!

## HelloWorld
This is most of Misty's Hello World tutorial from the offical Misty documentation. Nothing special.

## HourlyChime
I created this skill to learn how to use time in future skills. This skill uses the current time on Misty to Chime every hour. Instructions are included in the comments on how to set the time on Misty to your time zone. The number of chimes played is based on the hour (eg. 4 chimes at 4pm).

## ChinaTimeToLeaveAlarm
We needed a daily alarm clock to remind us when it was time to leave our manufacturer in China so we wouldn't keep the driver waiting. I decided to use Misty! This skill uses the current time on Misty and plays a car honking sound at the correct time. Instructions are included in the comments on how to set the time on Misty to your time zone.

## WeatherEyes
Push one of Misty's bump sensors and she will display the current weather in her eyes based on your location (that you set in the skill). I created this skill to learn how to integrate with an external API. Turned out to be super easy! I spent way more time in photoshop creating all the custom eye images than actually writing the code.

## SkillManager
Created by @CPsridharCP. Since only one skill (at random) will start at boot when you have multiple skills with the "Startup" flag set in your skills JSON file this skill manager will start multiple skills. Basically all your skills will need to be set to start manually only (no "Startup" flag in your JSON) except for this skill manager skill. This skill will then start the other skills.

## WakeOnPowerOn
Created by @CPsridharCP. Lifts up Misty's head after she boots.

## HandleCompliance
Created by @CPsridharCP. When you grab Misty's handle to pick her up her neck will go limp. After setting her down her neck will go back to the previous position.

Enjoy!
